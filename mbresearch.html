There are trillions of microorganisms inside your body. These include bacteria, fungi, protists, and viruses. Many of these
microorganisms (also referred to as microbes or microbiota) have a symbiotic relationship with us and are benefitial. 
What microorganisms live in you and the effect they have on you can vary.</p>

A majority of the microorganisms in your body can be found in your gut. They live by breaking down the food that we eat.
Some microbes can metabolize things that we can't. Since the survival of microbes depends on their ability to break down
the food in our GI tract, different diets have been shown to lead to different microbiomes.</p>

When microbiota metabolize foods, they can produce different things that affect us. These can be things like vitamins or
amino acids. The main things people have their eyes on is what is produced when fibers are broken down by microbiota.
This leads to the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). They are a nutrient source while also playing a role
in muscle function and have been shown to help in the prevention of chronic disease. Because of the effects of SCFAs, the 
most commonly recommended foods when talking about improving your microbiome are high-fiber.</p>

<h3 class="side">Gut-Brain Axis</h3>

<div class="dive">
<p class="big">
There is a connection between our brain and our gut through the nervous system that allows them to communicate.
The enertic nervous system is the most complex neural network besides the brain. The main connection between the enertic
nervous system and the brain is through the vagus nerve. Gut microbes play a role here by producing neurotransmitters and
chemicals that affect the brain. For example, the gut provides 95% of total body serotonin. Studies have also shown a link
between the state of the microbiome and emotions like anxiety, with change in the microbiome leading to change in feelings.</p>
