There has been a rise in probiotics in recent years. Probiotics are foods that naturally contain microbes, or supplement
pills with live bacteria. They are advertised to promote digestive health and have grown into a large industry. The
research on probiotics is conflicting, but some doctors say they can be useful for older people who have more difficulty
affecting the colonization of the microbiome. They may also be useful in situations of dysbiosis. Dysbiosis is when
something such as disease leads to the disruption of the normal balance of the microbiome. A probiotic replenishing normal
bacteria could be useful in these cases.</p>
<p>Coming from the established connection between the brain and gut, there has been a birth of a new class of probiotic
known as the psychobiotic. Psychobiotics are probiotics with the goal of improving psychiatric conditions. Several clinical
trials have been conducted on psychobiotics and their affect on depression and anxiety. Some have shown promising results
while others have seemed not very effective. Overall, most studies found positives results in improving symptoms. It is
sure that more research will need to be done on the clinical effects of psychobiotics.

Dysbiosis in gut microbes has been linked with GI conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
syndrome. Improvement of the microbiome has correlated with improvement with these conditions. The microbiome itself is
also known to have a connection with the immune system. Associations have been established between the gut microbiome
and a number of diseases and syndromes, the strength of these connections varying. Even if the microbiome is seen to not
have direct connection to these illnesses, it can be seen as a way through which anyone can improve their overall health.
